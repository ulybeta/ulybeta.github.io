        Mohlokoa,
        <br>
        <br>You were sitting on your couch in front of me and it was dark and you were wearing dark blue. You were being open and honest about your past. You were telling me about your time in New York, and what was going on in your body and mind during those months. I think you said something lie 'I almost died'. The darkness helped me hide away. I was full of fear because I was not remotely ready to be a listener and recipient of that. I was not deserving of the vulnerability you were showing.
        <br>
        <br>
        I know time has passed. I know you don't care. I know you don't need my explanations nor my apologies. I know you probably don't even remember. I know you don't need any of this. I'm doing this for myself. And to make a point. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I think about all the other topics I was not ready to discuss and share with you and I missed out on. And now I ache to know. I'd love to sit there hearing you dissect your dreams and your past, listen to you jumping from the most heartbreaking revelation to a sarcastic joke with your typical nonchalance. You'd mix yourself with art and pop culture references and silences, and your eyes would communicate as much as your words. Your smile would hold minuscule cracks whenver you'd share - but they'd be almost impossible to notice without paying attention. Your movements narrating a story would blend into a playlist. Your laugh. Your voice. Your laugh. Your voice again. Drawing patterns on the palm of your hand. Your gentle eyes. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a way you keep your head up, slowly blink your eyes, keep your lips closed in an expression that might come across as the beginning of a smile. But it's not a smile. Your lips stay closed, your chin is up, slightly pointed forward. There are a regality, a pride and a coldness about that expression - you did it when we met, you did it when we said goodbye. Both times, every single cell of my body paused. It scared me. It showed me your power. It attracted me. I want to witness that expression again, I want you to pause my cells and break for a few seconds the biocatalysis of my enzymes.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm sitting here writing while visualising that expression and my stomach is clenching.
        <br>
        <br>
        You were talking about the hair that sometime grows on your chin, and you were laughing. I was baffled by the way you could own your body because I could not even look at mine, or feel like it belonged to me. You were sharing  about your life, but you did not ask much back. I was too preoccupied thinking that meant you did not care to notice you were respecting my space and time. You were aware of your feelings and needs and showed courage to express them. You cared and were . I was disoriented by the lack of toxicity, because I grew to learn that love is. The absence of that toxic routine left me unshielded and I wanted to run away.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a way you place your hand on your neck when you are thinking of how to reply to an abstract question. I wonder how you learned to do that. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Your presence opens my mind in ways that I am never able to anticipate - your brain drives that . I'd love to watch your mind navigate the. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't believe in bad timing that much anymore. I think it is about growth. I was raw and not ready. I was not able to express and communicate what was happening inside me. I don't believe in the desire of changing the past. But I wish I could rephrase my words while it was happening. I believe in learning.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've been thriving with ambiguity all my life, a form of escapism, and satisfaction of old patterns wired in the back of my brain. But I want to give intention and clarity to you. I'm asking you if there is even a remote little chance you are interested in letting me know you. I'm asking you if there is even a remote little chance you are interested in listening and seeing what I have to share. I don't know if I can be the perfect listener, I don't know if I deserve to know all the aspects of you. But I have the interest, the intention, the ability to be there for it. I don't know if what I have to offer is good enough, interesting enough, challenging enough for you. But I have the courage and the earnestness to try it.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are 8,189.70 km between our bodies. There are 500 and counting days of your life I was not part of since the last time I saw your face. I am aware of the multitude of distances separating my reality from yours, both physical and not. I am aware there are people, circumstances, events, considerations, thoughts in your mind and life that I cannot address. So I am perhaps sounding naive, out of place, unrequested...  yet I need to tell you this.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've grown. I'm here. I'm open.
