        Mohlokoa,
        <br>
        <br>You were sitting on your couch in front of me and it was dark and you were wearing blue. You were being open and honest about your past. You were telling me about your time in New York, and what was going on in your body and mind during those months. I think you said something like 'I almost died'. I was full of fear because I was not remotely ready to be a listener and recipient of that. The darkness helped me hide away. I was not deserving of the vulnerability you were showing.
        <br>
        <br>
        I know time has passed, and you probably don't even remember. I know you don't need my explanations nor my apologies. I know you don't need any of this. I do.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think about all the other topics I was not ready to discuss with you and receive from you and share with you and I missed out on. I ache to know. To sit there hearing you dissect your dreams and your past, listen to you jumping from the most heartbreaking revelation to a sarcastic joke with your typical nonchalance. You mix yourself with art and pop culture references and silences, and your eyes communicate as much as your words. Your smile holds minuscule cracks whenever you tell of your fears - but they are almost impossible to notice without paying attention. Your movements narrating a story blend into a playlist. You are a dance. Your laugh. Your voice. Your laugh. Your voice again. Drawing patterns on the palm of your hand. Your gentle eyes. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a way you keep your head up, slowly blink your eyes, keep your lips closed in an expression that might come across as the beginning of a smile. But it's not. Your lips stay closed, your chin is up, slightly pointed forward. There are a regality, a pride and a coldness about that expression - you did it when we met, you did it when we said goodbye. Both times, every single cell of my body paused. It scares me. It shows me your power. It seduces me. I long for that expression, for that to break the biocatalysis of my enzymes for a few seconds.
        <br>
        <br>
        You were talking about the hair that sometimes grows on your chin, and you were laughing. I was dazed by the way you owned your body while I could not even look at mine or feel like it belonged to me. You were sharing stories about your life, but you did not ask much back. I was too preoccupied thinking that meant you did not care to notice you were patiently respecting my space and time. You were aware of your feelings and needs and showed little hesitation in expressing them. I had not yet found my way to authenticity. You cared. I was disoriented by the lack of toxicity. I grew to learn that love is ambiguous, tied to fear, ambivalence, confusion. The absence of a toxic routine left me unshielded and I wanted to run away.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is a way you place your hand on your neck when you are thinking about how to reply to an abstract question. I think about that movement of yours a lot.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your presence opens my mind in ways that I am never able to anticipate - your brain and humour drive that. Chasing your wanderings. It's exciting trying to catch up. I'd love to watch you navigate the tragicomic daily dilemmas of human existence. To witness your thumbs sitting on your neck while you ponder one after another.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm asking you if there is a chance you are interested in letting me know you. I'm asking you if there is a chance you are interested in getting to know me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are 8,189.70 km between our bodies. There are 498 and counting days of your life I was not part of since the last time I saw you. I am aware of the multitude of distances separating my reality from yours, physical and not. I am aware there are people, circumstances, events, thoughts in your mind and life that I cannot address. So I will sound naive and out of place.  Yet I need to share this.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've grown. I'm here. I'm open.
        <br>
